Marmalade Port of TinyHttp â€”

 *  A trivial  and incomplete http implementation to enable serving of local files via marmalade
 *  See http://tinyhttpd.sourceforge.net/ for orginal 
 
 s3eWebViewBasic.mkb  - is a modified version of the marmalade example - it has depends on 
 the other marmalade examples - so you will need to copy it your marmalde examples folder
 
 UltraTinyHttpD - contains a drop in MKF for your projects
 
 PROBLEM
 =======
 
 Using Android the default web browser denies conenctions to 127.0.0.1 when wifi is disbaled.
 I havnt found a workaroudn for this yet - apparently other browsers - i.e opera
 will connect fine although thats useless at present as the web view wil not use them :( 
 
 Id really appreciate ideas about this!
